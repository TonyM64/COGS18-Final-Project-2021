    "## Description:\n",
    "\n",
    "For my final project I decided to make a Dragon Ball Quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "I grew up watching the anime and reading the manga for as long as I can remember. For this project, I decided to make this quiz that asks you 10 questions about the Dragon Ball franchise.\n",
    "\n",
    "To create this whole thing, I made a class called \"Questions\", which has to be imported. It has a method with two inputs, because as I was going through the creation of this quiz, realized that I really only needed two. Those two inputs are \"multiple_choice\" and \"answer\". By caalling on this class in this notebook, the list of questions asked, and insert them as its \"multiple choice\" input, with their correct answer being inserted as the \"answer\" input.\n",
    "\n",
    "The next thing I did was that I imported the required three functions I created in the functions.py file, **\"multiple_choice\"**, **\"maximum_score\"** and **\"begin_test\"**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* The function **\"multiple_choice\"** is a function that takes an input for the assigned question and adds a point to the test taker's score if they get the question right.\n",
    "* The function **\"maximum_score\"** is a function that takes in a input from 0 to 10, and it prints a string with a message that corresponds to the amount of questions you get right.\n",
    "* The function **\"begin_test\"** will run the questions using a for loop and add 1 to score if you got the previous question correct. At the end of the loop, it will call the maximum_score fucntion. When it does this, it'll take your score, whatever it may be, as an input and return a message unique to your score out of 10.\n",
    "\n",
    "After doing this, I created a list called \"questions_multiple_choice\". This list has a list of questions followed by the 4 possible answers: a, b, c, and d. Then I assigned each question in that list to the \"multiple_choice\" input/method of my \"Questions\" class. The correct response to each question is assigned in string from the class \"answer\". Then I named a variable \"questions\" and assigned this new list to it. \n",
    "\n",
    "The last thing I did was that I ran the \"begin_test\" function and insert list \"questions\" as inputs. This initiates the loop through the questions, thus starting the quiz.\n",
    "\n",
    "All there is to do now is to take the quiz\n",
    "I hope you have fun!!!!"
